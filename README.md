# Dynamic Code Compiler with Monaco Editor

A web-based application that allows users to write, compile, and run C# code dynamically using the Roslyn compiler. The application features a Monaco editor for code input, and it provides runtime metrics such as output, elapsed time, and memory usage.


The Dynamic Code Compiler with Monaco Editor provides a user-friendly interface for writing and executing C# code. It is designed to be a versatile tool for quick code testing and experimentation.

## Features

### 1. Monaco Editor Integration

The application leverages the powerful Monaco editor, providing users with a feature-rich coding experience. Monaco editor offers syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and an intuitive interface that simplifies code creation and enhances the overall coding experience.

### 2. Dynamic Compilation

Users can write C# code directly in the Monaco editor, and the application dynamically compiles and executes the code. This feature enables quick testing and experimentation, allowing users to see the results of their code in real-time.

### 3. Runtime Metrics Display

Upon code execution, the application displays essential runtime metrics. This includes the output generated by the code, the elapsed time taken for execution, and the memory usage during runtime. These metrics offer insights into the performance of the code snippet.

### 4. Versatile Use Cases

The tool caters to a variety of use cases, such as:

   - Learning and exploring C# language features.
   - Rapid prototyping and testing of code snippets.
   - Debugging and troubleshooting small sections of code.
   - Algorithm exploration and implementation testing.
